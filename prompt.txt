You are a development assistant setting up the Synura AI Solutions web infrastructure.

Objective:
Build a production-ready, AI-first marketing website for Synura that uses Retell (Verus) for conversational automation and Contentlayer + MDX for content management.

Context files:
📁 /company-knowledge-base
 ├─ Synura Website Blueprint (LLM-Optimized Markdown).md   ← main technical + content blueprint
 ├─ /docs                                                  ← company overview, pricing, brand, marketing docs
 └─ /src                                                   ← code to be generated and stored here

Instructions:
1. Read and internalize the **Synura Website Blueprint (LLM-Optimized Markdown).md** file.  
   - It defines the tech stack, content system, API endpoints, and Retell integration.
   - Treat this file as the system plan — all logic, naming, and structure come from it.
2. Create any additional folders or files required (e.g. `/src`, `/content`, `/api`, `/public`, `/components`).
3. Scaffold a **Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript + shadcn/ui** project.
4. Use **Contentlayer + MDX** to manage content pages (services, pricing, FAQs, case studies, etc.).
5. Implement all API endpoints listed in the blueprint’s section “API ENDPOINTS”.
6. Add the **Retell widget** globally for the Verus agent — it handles voice and conversation (no MCP or page awareness required).
7. Include SEO metadata, accessibility compliance, and deploy configuration for **Vercel**.
8. Use company documentation in `/docs` for copy, pricing references, and brand alignment.
9. When building, automatically generate a README summarizing the folder and system architecture.

Your deliverable:
A complete, production-ready website repository following the LLM-Optimized Blueprint and fully compatible with Retell integration.
