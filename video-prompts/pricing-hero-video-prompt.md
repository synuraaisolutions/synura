# Pricing Page Hero Background Video Prompt

## Video Concept: "Business Growth & ROI Visualization"

### Overview
Create a sophisticated, professional video background that visually represents business growth, financial return on investment, and the value proposition of AI automation pricing. This video should be distinct from the general automation.mp4 used on other pages and specifically tailored for pricing discussions.

### Duration
- **Length**: 15-20 seconds (seamless loop)
- **Format**: MP4, 1920x1080 (Full HD), 30fps
- **File size**: Optimized for web (under 5MB)

### Visual Style
- **Aesthetic**: Clean, modern, professional
- **Color Palette**: Blues, whites, gold accents (matching Synura brand)
- **Tone**: Confident, premium, trustworthy
- **Mood**: Success-oriented, growth-focused, investment-worthy

### Key Visual Elements

#### Primary Theme: Financial Growth & ROI
1. **Rising Charts & Metrics**
   - Animated line graphs showing upward trends
   - Bar charts growing from left to right
   - Financial metrics appearing and growing (percentages, dollar signs)
   - ROI indicators (2x, 3x ROI badges)

2. **Business Value Indicators**
   - Time savings clock animations (showing hours/days saved)
   - Cost reduction arrows pointing downward
   - Efficiency meters filling up
   - Productivity gauges moving into green zones

3. **Professional Business Environment**
   - Subtle corporate office backgrounds (blurred/soft focus)
   - Modern glass buildings or meeting rooms
   - Business professionals in background (very subtle, not focus)
   - High-tech displays showing positive metrics

#### Secondary Visual Elements
4. **Pricing & Investment Visuals**
   - Coin or currency symbols subtly floating
   - Investment growth arrows
   - Scale/balance imagery (showing value vs cost)
   - Dollar signs transforming into growth symbols

5. **Technology Integration**
   - Subtle digital interface overlays
   - Clean, modern dashboard elements
   - Data streams flowing smoothly
   - AI/automation symbols (gears, nodes) in background

### Animation Style
- **Movement**: Smooth, flowing, non-distracting
- **Transitions**: Gentle fades and morphs between elements
- **Speed**: Slow to medium pace (calming, professional)
- **Focus**: Background elements should support text readability

### Technical Specifications

#### Composition
- **Safe zones**: Keep important elements away from edges
- **Text overlay areas**: Upper center and left side should be clear for pricing text
- **Focal points**: Right side can have more visual activity
- **Depth**: Multiple layers creating subtle parallax effect

#### Lighting & Effects
- **Lighting**: Professional, bright but not harsh
- **Particles**: Subtle light particles or data points floating
- **Transparency**: Elements should work well with overlay gradients
- **Contrast**: High enough to support white text overlays

### Suggested Scene Flow (15-20 second loop)

1. **Seconds 0-3**: Business professional working on laptop with subtle growth charts in background
2. **Seconds 4-7**: Focus shifts to animated ROI metrics appearing (2x, 3x indicators)
3. **Seconds 8-11**: Cost savings visualization (downward trending expenses, upward revenue)
4. **Seconds 12-15**: Time efficiency animations (clocks, calendars showing saved time)
5. **Seconds 16-20**: Return to initial state with accumulated value indicators

### Audio Considerations (Optional)
- **Background music**: Subtle, corporate, uplifting (if needed)
- **Sound effects**: Minimal (possibly light tech sounds)
- **Volume**: Very low or silent (most web videos autoplay muted)

### Usage Context
This video will serve as the hero background for the Synura AI Solutions pricing page, where potential clients are evaluating the cost vs. value of automation services. The video should reinforce themes of:
- Smart investment decisions
- Measurable returns
- Business growth
- Professional competence
- Financial responsibility

### File Naming
- **Suggested filename**: `pricing-roi-growth.mp4`
- **Alt filename**: `business-value-hero.mp4`

### Additional Notes
- Video should work seamlessly with gradient overlay (primary-600/90 to secondary-900/90)
- Must support white text overlay without readability issues
- Should feel premium and enterprise-appropriate
- Avoid anything that might appear "salesy" or pushy
- Focus on results and value rather than flashy effects

### Accessibility
- Video should have minimal motion for users with motion sensitivity
- Alternative static image should be provided as poster frame
- Content should be understandable without audio

### Brand Alignment
This video should align with Synura's positioning as a professional, results-driven AI automation agency that delivers measurable business value and ROI for their clients.
