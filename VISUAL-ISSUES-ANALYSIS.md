# Synura AI Solutions Website - Visual Issues Analysis Report

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Deployment URL:** https://synura.ai (configured in vercel.json)
**Current Status:** Build failing due to MDX syntax errors

---

## Executive Summary

The Synura website is experiencing deployment failures that prevent the site from being properly built and deployed. The build process completes for most pages but fails on all service detail pages due to MDX content parsing errors. This analysis examines the visual and functional issues based on the codebase review.

---

## Critical Build Issues

### 1. MDX Syntax Errors Blocking Deployment

**Status:** BLOCKING DEPLOYMENT

All service detail pages are failing to build with the error:
```
SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
```

**Affected Pages:**
- `/services/ai-consulting`
- `/services/ai-workforce`
- `/services/automation-integration`
- `/services/managed-operations`

**Impact:** The services pages are completely non-functional in production, which explains the user's feedback that "services page is pretty much nonfunctional."

**Root Cause:** The MDX files in `/content/services/` contain syntax that the MDX parser cannot properly process. The error occurs in the `getMDXComponent` function during the build process.

**Files to Check:**
- `/Users/collinmclaughlin/Synurawebsite/content/services/ai-consulting.mdx`
- `/Users/collinmclaughlin/Synurawebsite/content/services/ai-workforce.mdx`
- `/Users/collinmclaughlin/Synurawebsite/content/services/automation-integration.mdx`
- `/Users/collinmclaughlin/Synurawebsite/content/services/managed-operations.mdx`

## Visual Issues Identified

### 2. Logo Distortion in Header

**Status:** POTENTIAL ISSUE

**Current Implementation:**
```tsx
// File: /Users/collinmclaughlin/Synurawebsite/src/components/layout/header.tsx (lines 26-32)
<Image
  src="/images/synura-logo.svg"
  alt="Synura AI Solutions"
  width={200}
  height={120}
  className="h-10 w-auto"
/>
```

**Issue Analysis:**
- The logo SVG has an intrinsic aspect ratio of 200x120 (5:3 ratio)
- Next.js Image component is configured with `width={200}` and `height={120}`
- The className applies `h-10 w-auto`, which should preserve aspect ratio
- However, the explicit width/height props may conflict with the Tailwind classes

**Visual Impact:**
- The logo appears alongside text ("Synura" / "AI Solutions") which may create visual clutter
- The SVG contains both the gear/circuit graphic AND the text "SYNURA" and "AI SOLUTIONS"
- This creates a double-text issue where the logo text appears next to redundant React text

**Current Logo Structure:**
```
[Gear Icon with circuit] + "SYNURA" text (in SVG) + "AI SOLUTIONS" text (in SVG)
     NEXT TO
"Synura" (React component text)
"AI Solutions" (React component text)
```

**Recommended Fix:**
1. Either use the full logo SVG WITHOUT the additional text components in React
2. OR create a logo-icon-only SVG (just the gear/circuit) and keep the React text
3. Ensure aspect ratio is preserved by removing explicit width/height and relying only on Tailwind classes

### 3. Missing Images Throughout Site

**Status:** CONFIRMED ISSUE

**Current Image Inventory:**
```
/public/images/
  - synura-logo.svg
  - synura-logo-white.svg
```

**Issue:** The website only has 2 image files (both logos), no other visual assets.

**Pages Using Only Icons/Emojis:**
- Homepage: Uses emoji icons (ü§ñ, üîÑ, üéØ, ‚öôÔ∏è, üìã, üõ†Ô∏è, üìà)
- Services page: Uses emoji icons for service cards
- Service detail pages: No images, only icons

**Visual Impact:**
- The site relies entirely on emoji icons instead of professional graphics
- No hero images, feature illustrations, or team photos
- No case study images or client logos
- Creates a text-heavy, unprofessional appearance
- Lacks visual hierarchy and engagement elements

**Design Philosophy Issue:**
The current design uses a minimalist approach with emoji icons, which may appear:
- Unprofessional for B2B/enterprise clients
- Generic and not branded
- Less engaging than custom illustrations or photos

---

### 4. Services Page Functionality

**Status:** NON-FUNCTIONAL (Due to MDX Build Errors)

**Current Implementation:**
The services listing page (`/services/page.tsx`) is well-structured and should work, but individual service pages fail to render due to MDX parsing errors.

**Services Listing Page Structure:**
- Hero section with CTA
- Featured services grid (filters by `featured: true`)
- Complete service portfolio
- Implementation process overview
- CTA section

**Issue:** When users click "Learn More" on any service, they're routed to `/services/[slug]` which fails to load due to build errors.

**User Experience Impact:**
- Users can see the services overview
- Clicking any service detail link results in a 404 or error page
- Makes the entire services section appear broken

---

## Conclusion

The primary issue blocking the Synura website is the MDX syntax errors preventing service pages from building. Once these are resolved, the site should deploy successfully. The secondary issues (logo distortion and missing images) are visual quality concerns that impact the professional appearance of the site but don't block functionality.

The site has a solid foundation with good design system, typography, and layout structure. With the MDX fixes and addition of professional imagery, the site will present a much more polished and engaging experience for visitors.
