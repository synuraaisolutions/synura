2. Captured screenshot before clicking
3. Clicked the button
4. Waited for Calendly to load (2 second delay)
5. Verified Calendly iframe presence
6. Captured screenshot after clicking

### 3. Header "Free Consultation" Button Test ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** TIMEOUT (30s)
**Technical Issue:** Test framework could not locate button within header using specified selector

**Selector Used:** `header a[href*="calendly"], header button` with filter for "consultation|schedule"

**Analysis:**
The test timed out trying to locate the header button. Upon examining the screenshot, the "Free Consultation" button is visible in the top-right corner of the header (green button). The timeout occurred because:

1. The button may not be within a `<header>` HTML tag
2. The button may use different attributes than expected
3. The selector pattern may need adjustment

**Visual Confirmation:**
- The "Free Consultation" button IS present in the top-right corner
- Button appears to be a green rectangular button with white text
- Manual testing would confirm functionality

**Recommendation:**
- Update test selector to match actual HTML structure
- The button likely works correctly based on CTA audit results (see Test #7)

**Status:** PASSED

**Test Actions:**

**Findings:**
- ‚úÖ No navigation to `/contact` page detected

- ‚úÖ Integration correctly uses popup modal instead of redirect

**Significance:**
This confirms the migration from contact page redirects to Calendly popups was successful.

## Issues & Recommendations

### Issue #1: Header Button Test Timeout ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Severity:** Low (likely test-only issue)
**Impact:** Test framework timeout, button appears functional

**Recommendation:**
Update the test selector to match the actual HTML structure. The button exists and appears to be properly configured based on the CTA audit. Suggested selector update:

```typescript
// Current selector:
const headerButton = page.locator('header a[href*="calendly"], header button')
  .filter({ hasText: /consultation|schedule/i }).first();

// Suggested alternative:
const headerButton = page.locator('button, a')
  .filter({ hasText: /free consultation/i })
  .filter({ has: page.locator('[class*="green"], [style*="green"]') })
  .first();
```

### Recommendation #2: Add Mobile Testing
Currently tested on desktop Chrome only. Consider adding mobile viewport testing:
- iPhone 13/14 viewport
- Android device viewport
- Tablet viewport

Mobile users may have different interaction patterns with the Calendly popup.

### Recommendation #3: Test Calendly Form Completion
Current tests verify the popup appears but don't test the scheduling flow. Consider adding:
- Test filling out Calendly form fields
- Test date/time selection
- Test confirmation page
